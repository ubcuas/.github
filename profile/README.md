<!----- About Us ----->

The University of British Columbia Uncrewed Aircraft Systems engineering student team (UBC UAS) is a multidisciplinary group of students spanning multiple faculties, including Engineering, Forestry, Science, Art, and Business. We strive to be at the cutting edge of uncrewed aviation technologies, working with industry and government in making use of UAS in a broad spectrum of disciplines and applications.

UBC UAS provides our members with a chance to follow their passion for unmanned aviation and its applications. Positions and projects within the team range from aircraft design to network communications to image processing. Additionally, our team works closely with multiple faculty, industry, and government representatives to provide a wide range of educational and fun experiences for team members. This includes flight training, ground school, and chances to work with professors and research students. Check out [our website](https://ubcuas.com) if you are interested in joining!
